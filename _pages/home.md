## About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University, in the Natural Language Processing Lab, advised by Prof. Yoav Goldberg.

I work on evaluating the robustness of Large Language Models to variations in reasoning tasks.

Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Data Science, and Linguistics, at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
